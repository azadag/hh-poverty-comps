hh-poverty-comps
================

Creates international comparisons of market and post transfer household poverty rates by household type 
(partner, children status) for use with LIS micro-data.

Stata code is used with the [LIS Data Center's](http://www.lisdatacenter.org/) cross-country micro-data LISSY interface.

Three types of data are outputed for each country. Code needs to be manually adjusted for each country 
that is added to the list. Sorry, I'm not a great Stata programmer.

Note, that code will not work for countries that use different income data definitions e.g. Sweden, Japan.
